**Phase 4: Competitive Gap Analysis (if my_domain provided)**
IF my_domain is provided:
  FOR EACH competitor in [competitors]:
    - semrush_keyword_gap(target_domain=my_domain, competitor_domain=competitor, database={{primary_market}}, limit=20)
    → Find keywords each competitor ranks for but my_domain does not
    → IF returns "No gaps found": Document it and CONTINUE to next competitor
ELSE:
  → Skip this phase and document "Gap analysis skipped - no my_domain provided"
