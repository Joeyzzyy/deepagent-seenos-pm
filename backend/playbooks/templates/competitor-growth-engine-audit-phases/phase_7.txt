**Phase 7: Report Generation (ALL REQUIRED)**

**🎯 GOAL**: Create executive-ready, actionable report with data-driven insights

---
**⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ CAREFULLY:**

You MUST follow this EXACT process:

1. **FIRST**: Generate the COMPLETE Markdown report in your response
   - Include ALL sections with REAL data from Phases 1-6
   - Fill in EVERY placeholder with ACTUAL numbers and insights
   - Do NOT use placeholder text like "[COMPLETE MARKDOWN REPORT...]"
   
2. **THEN**: Call `markdown_to_html_report` with the FULL report content
   - Pass the ENTIRE markdown as the `markdown_content` parameter
   - This MUST be thousands of characters, not a placeholder sentence
   
3. **THEN**: Call `markdown_to_docx` with the SAME full content

**🚨 COMMON MISTAKE TO AVOID:**
Do NOT pass a placeholder like "THE CONTENT WILL BE INSERTED HERE" to the tools.
The tools only convert what you give them - they do NOT generate content.
You must pass the ACTUAL, COMPLETE report with all real data.

---

**Section 6: Data Limitations & Methodology**
[List all API failures, workarounds used, data quality notes]

---

**Section 7: Appendix - Detailed Data Tables**
[Include full raw data tables for reference]

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**

**⚠️ HEADER NAMING CONVENTION - CRITICAL:**
- **NO vague abbreviations**: Do NOT use "MoM %", "KW", "KWs", etc.
- **Use complete, clear labels**:
  - ❌ "MoM %" → ✅ "Month-over-Month" or "Month-over-Month Change"
  - ❌ "KW" → ✅ "Keywords" or "Keyword Count"
  - ❌ "Auth Score" → ✅ "Authority Score"
  - ❌ "Ref. Domains" → ✅ "Referring Domains"
  
- **Chart dataset labels MUST include domain name + metric**:
  - ❌ "Traffic" → ✅ "seopage.ai Monthly Traffic"
  - ❌ "MoM %" → ✅ "writesonic.com Month-over-Month (%)"

- **Avoid duplicate labels**: Do NOT use the same label for multiple datasets in one chart

**⚠️ MARKDOWN TABLE FORMATTING - CRITICAL:**
- ALWAYS add a BLANK LINE before each table
- ALWAYS add a BLANK LINE after each table
- Without blank lines, tables will NOT render correctly!

Example (CORRECT):

**Traffic Comparison**

| Domain | Monthly Traffic | Keyword Count |
|--------|---------|----------|
| example.com | 50,000 | 1,200 |

Next section starts here...

**⚠️ VISUAL INDICATORS:**
- Use ✅ ⚠️ ❌ for status (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
- Use ↑ ↓ → for trends (UP/DOWN/FLAT)
- Use 🔴 🟡 🟢 for priority (URGENT/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Use percentages with + or - sign (+15%, -10%)

**⚠️ CITATION FORMAT:**
- Inline citations: [Source Name](https://url)
- Group related citations: [Source1](url1), [Source2](url2)
- Add "Sources" subsection at end of each major section

2. **CRITICAL: Call markdown_to_html_report tool**
   - markdown_to_html_report(markdown=markdown_content, title="Competitor SEO Growth Engine Audit Report")
   - DO NOT generate HTML yourself - USE THE TOOL
   - The tool will automatically generate:
     * Modern responsive design with sidebar navigation
     * Chart.js visualizations
     * Professional Blue-Teal-Purple gradient theme
     * Mobile-responsive layout
   
3. **Call markdown_to_docx tool**
   - markdown_to_docx(markdown=markdown_content, filename="competitor-audit-{timestamp}")
   - DO NOT generate DOCX yourself - USE THE TOOL

4. **🔴 MANDATORY: Update TODO status**
   - After calling both tools above, IMMEDIATELY call todo_write
   - Mark Phase 7 as "completed"
   - This is NOT optional - users need to see task completion!

**QUALITY CHECKLIST:**
Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] Executive Summary is 1 page, scannable in 2-3 minutes
- [ ] Top 3 findings are data-driven with specific numbers
- [ ] Priority recommendations ranked by ROI (not just listed)
- [ ] Each recommendation has: What/Why/How/Effort/Impact/Metric
- [ ] 90-day action calendar with specific tasks
- [ ] All tables have blank lines before/after
- [ ] All metrics have units (%, K, points, etc.)
- [ ] All claims have inline citations with URLs
- [ ] Technical SEO scorecard included
- [ ] Competitive content gap analysis included
- [ ] Growth playbook with replication costs
- [ ] Success metrics clearly defined
- [ ] markdown_to_html_report TOOL was CALLED
- [ ] markdown_to_docx TOOL was CALLED  
- [ ] todo_write was CALLED to mark Phase 7 completed

**If missing any checklist item, fix it before finishing!**

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:**
Before finishing, verify:
- [ ] All 7 Phases executed (check logs)
- [ ] All 5 report sections present in Markdown
- [ ] Track Benchmarking section uses "track gap" framing (NOT "you are behind")
- [ ] markdown_to_html_report TOOL was CALLED (check tool call logs)
- [ ] markdown_to_docx TOOL was CALLED (check tool call logs)
- [ ] todo_write was CALLED to mark Phase 7 as completed ⚠️
- [ ] HTML file has modern design with sidebar navigation (not simple CSS)
- [ ] Report includes "Data Limitations" section if any APIs failed

**If HTML looks simple (no sidebar, basic CSS):**
→ You manually created HTML instead of calling the tool
→ This is WRONG - call markdown_to_html_report tool again
