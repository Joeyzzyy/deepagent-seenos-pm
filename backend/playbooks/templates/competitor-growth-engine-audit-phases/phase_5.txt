**Phase 5: Track Popularity Benchmarking (REQUIRED)**

**Purpose**: 
Provide strategic context by comparing the user's industry track against a trending/high-traffic reference track.
This helps assess whether the user's track is hot/mature/niche and set realistic SEO expectations.

**CRITICAL - This is NOT a "you vs them" comparison. It's a TRACK SIZE reference.**

**Execution**:
1. perplexity_search(query="most popular trending [adjacent vertical] products high traffic SEO 2024 2025 site:ahrefs.com OR site:semrush.com")
   → Find a trending/hot category (e.g., AI Video Generation, Project Management SaaS, etc.)
   → Look for categories with strong organic growth
   → Prefer categories adjacent but different from user's industry
   → IF search fails: Document "Benchmark search unavailable" + SKIP this phase
   
2. Select 2-3 leading products from the benchmark track
   → Choose well-known successful products (e.g., HeyGen for AI Video)
   
3. semrush_domain_overview_batch(domains=[benchmark1, benchmark2, benchmark3], database={{primary_market}})
   → Get traffic data for benchmark track
   → IF API fails: Document "Benchmark data unavailable" + SKIP
   
4. Calculate track gap metrics:
   - Benchmark Track Avg Traffic = AVG(benchmark domains traffic)
   - Your Track Avg Traffic = AVG(analyzed domains traffic)
   - Track Gap Multiplier = Benchmark Avg / Your Avg
   
**CRITICAL REPORTING RULES FOR BENCHMARK SECTION**:

❌ **NEVER use these phrases**:
- "You are behind"
- "You lag significantly"
- "Your domain is weaker"
- "You need to catch up"

✅ **ALWAYS use these phrases**:
- "Your track receives [X]x less/more traffic than benchmark track"
- "Track gap: [X]x (indicates benchmark track is [more popular/similar/less popular])"
- "This suggests your track is [mature/growing/niche] relative to trending categories"
- "For reference only - not a competitive comparison"

**Required Report Structure**:

Output the following section in your Markdown report:

## Track Popularity Benchmarking

**Purpose**: Understand your industry's relative SEO potential by comparing against a high-traffic reference track. This helps set realistic expectations and assess track competitiveness.

**Benchmark Track Selected**: [Track Name] (e.g., AI Video Generation)
**Selection Reason**: Currently trending with strong organic traffic growth in 2024-2025

**Your Track**: [User's Industry]

### Track Size Comparison

**Complete Domain Breakdown** (All Products Side-by-Side):

| Domain | Type | Monthly Traffic | Organic Keywords | Authority Score |
|--------|------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| [your_domain1] | Your Product | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |
| [your_domain2] | Your Product | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |
| [competitor1] | Your Competitor | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |
| [competitor2] | Your Competitor | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |
| [benchmark1] | Benchmark (Hot Track) | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |
| [benchmark2] | Benchmark (Hot Track) | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |
| [benchmark3] | Benchmark (Hot Track) | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] |

**Track Averages**:

| Track | Avg Monthly Traffic | Avg Keywords | Avg Authority | Gap vs Benchmark |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| Your Products | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] | [W]x |
| Your Competitors | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] | [W]x |
| Benchmark Track | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z] | 1.0x (baseline) |

### Track Gap Interpretation

**Track Multiplier**: [Z]x

**What This Means**:

[IF gap < 2x]:
- Your track and the benchmark track have similar SEO potential
- Both are attracting comparable organic traffic levels
- Competition level may be similar

[IF gap 2-5x]:
- Moderate track size difference
- The benchmark track is more popular currently
- Your track may be more mature or niche

[IF gap 5-10x]:
- Significant track size difference  
- The benchmark track is substantially more popular
- Consider this context when setting SEO goals

[IF gap > 10x]:
- Major track popularity gap
- The benchmark track is in an exceptionally high-growth phase
- Your track is more established/niche or earlier stage

### Strategic Context

**For SEO Planning**:
- Use benchmark traffic as a reference ceiling, not a direct goal
- [Smaller/Similar/Larger] track size suggests [adjust strategy accordingly]
- Set realistic growth targets based on track maturity

**For Business Decisions**:
- Track popularity doesn't determine product success
- Niche/mature tracks can have strong monetization
- Consider product-market fit over pure traffic volume

**Note**: This benchmark compares TRACK POPULARITY, not your product quality or competitive position. Products in smaller tracks can achieve excellent business outcomes through differentiation and strong product-market fit.
